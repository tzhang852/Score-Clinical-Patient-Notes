# Score-Clinical-Patient-Notes
Kaggle Competition Code base for NBME - Score Clinical Patient Notes

In this competition, you’ll identify specific clinical concepts in patient notes. Specifically, you'll develop an automated method to map clinical concepts from an exam rubric (e.g., “diminished appetite”) to various ways in which these concepts are expressed in clinical patient notes written by medical students (e.g., “eating less,” “clothes fit looser”).
